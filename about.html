                <h2>Hello!</h2> 
                <p>My name is Peter and I’m currently a senior studying at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, pursuing a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering and a Master’s in Robotic Engineering. I've made this website to attempt to compile what I have been working on so you can get a better idea of who I am.</p>

            <div id="itemAbout" class="itemAbout">
                <p>I grew up in eastern Massachusetts and received my IB diploma at <a style="font-size: 1rem; hover{color: white;}" href="https://www.sturgischarterschool.com/">Sturgis Charter Public School</a> in 2019. Throughout these last three years, I’ve been surrounded by some incredibly smart people at school who have introduced me to ideas and projects I’ve been fascinated with. As of late, I’ve been getting involved with some of these. Among them, a 50+ member <a style="font-size: 1rem; hover{color: white;}" href="https://aiaa.wpi.edu/hprc/">rocketry club</a> that sends a 8.8 lb payload to 10-30 thousand feet- I’ve had the humble role of helping out with the mechanical payload design and general electronic circuit design. During the summer months, I have worked as an intern at EdgeTech and Teledyne Marine where I’ve had the opportunity to work on mechanical design, drawings, and a python tool to help out the navigation of autonomous underwater gliders. When I have the time, I work on projects of my own, some of which I showcase in my projects section!</p>
