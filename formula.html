            <p>My senior capstone project is a collaboration between myself and 20 others in the design, optimization, and fabrication of an Electric FSAE Vehicle that competes in the annual Formula SAE Hybrid design competition. </p>
        <p>The engineering marvel you see above is <span class="emphasized">Purple Haze</span>, a fully operational race car built by last year’s team. This year, our job is to improve it. Despite the zebra print and questionable bodywork, Purple Haze is an impressive little car, boasting an EMRAX motor capable of 124kW and 230 Nm at peak output. It’s powered by a custom-built accumulator that draws power from 448 lithium-ion cells, and is capable of 180A at 470.4V.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am working on the Accumulator Redesign team. As the name would suggest, our task is to overhaul the design of our battery. Here’s a sneak peak at our model.</p>
